# rebel-scum


This is a cute lil' generator for the 9th Level RPG "Rebel Scum" Created by Chris O'Neill

It generates a ship and a crew of selected size.

All output prints directly to the console. I recommend having a terminal window opened large (and wide enough) for text spacing otherwise it won't look nice.

It slow prints to give it that nice old school feel.

Flavor text pops up here and there as it's printing.

**Note:** Must have Python 3.12 or higher for this to run correctly. Otherwise you'll get errors because of the '\' being used in my 'f'-strings.



## To be added

* Add ability to re-generate at each stage
* Add dice roller
* output text file with results
* Develop web app via streamlit (as a start)
